### ðŸ”„ What to Expect

The live representative will:

1. **Receive the call** in the designated transfer queue within Sytel.
2. **Navigate to the "Recently Transferred Calls" page** in Electrify to confirm and view transfer details.
3. **Click the blue call ID** for the most recent entry to open a detailed call summary.
4. **Review key information** before assisting to the caller:
   - Caller details (e.g., name)
   - Right Party Verification (RPV) status (e.g., successfully completed or not)
   - AI-generated call summary
   - Transcript of the AI portion of the conversation thus far
5. **Resume the conversation** with full context and assist the caller with the remainder of their inquiry or issue.

### âœ… Best Practices

- Take a moment to **skim the transcript and summary** before engaging â€” this saves time and avoids asking the caller to repeat themselves.
- If any data seems incomplete or unclear, ask clarifying questions early in the call.
- Note any recurring issues or caller frustrations to provide feedback to the team for AI improvements.

This process ensures a smooth handoff from AI to live agent, preserving context and minimizing caller friction.
